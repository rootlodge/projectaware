```

This shows:
- CEREBRUM's identity and mission
- All 7 specialized sub-agents with their roles
- Decision thresholds
- Current system state

#### Process Input Through Central Brain
```
process through brain <your input>
```

## üîç What to Look For

### Successful Processing Indicators
- ‚úÖ **Response Quality**: Coherent, contextually appropriate responses
- ‚úÖ **Delegation Success**: Appropriate specialists chosen for tasks
- ‚úÖ **Synthesis Success**: Multiple agent responses combined effectively
- ‚úÖ **Actions Taken**: Identity changes, agent creation, workflows executed
- ‚úÖ **Emotional Context**: Appropriate emotional tone and responses
- ‚úÖ **Learning Integration**: System learns from interactions

### Key Metrics Displayed
- **Delegations**: Number of specialist agents involved
- **Actions Taken**: What system actions were performed
- **New Agents Created**: If specialized agents were created
- **Synthesis Success**: Whether response synthesis worked
- **Emotional Context**: Current emotional state integration

## üéØ Advanced Testing

### Test Agent Creation
**Input:** `process through brain I need a specialized agent for music composition`
**Expected:** New agent creation with music-specific identity

### Test Emergency Override
```javascript
// In console or test script
centralBrain.emergencyOverride('emotional_reset', 'test_emergency');
```

### Test Decision Threshold Adjustment
```javascript
// In console or test script
centralBrain.adjustDecisionThresholds({
  createNewAgent: 0.5,
  emotionalOverride: 0.9
});
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Check Logs
Look for these log entries:
- `[CentralBrain] Processing input: ...`
- `[CentralBrain] Delegated to [AGENT_NAME]: ...`
- `[CentralBrain] Identity managed by PERSONA`
- `[CentralBrain] Learning recorded by SCHOLAR`

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Unknown specialist: [agent_name]"
**Solution:** Check that the agent name matches exactly the subAgents map keys:
- `thinker` ‚Üí COGITATOR
- `identity_manager` ‚Üí PERSONA
- `emotion_processor` ‚Üí EMPATHIA
- `responder` ‚Üí ELOQUENS
- `decision_maker` ‚Üí JUDEX
- `learner` ‚Üí SCHOLAR
- `monitor` ‚Üí VIGIL

#### Issue: JSON parsing errors
**Solution:** The LLM response format might be inconsistent. Check the strategic decision prompt.

#### Issue: Synthesis failures
**Solution:** Multiple agent responses might be conflicting. Check delegation logic.

## üìä Performance Testing

### Automated Test Suite
Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
node tests/test-central-brain.js
```

### Manual Performance Tests
1. **Response Time**: Test with various input complexities
2. **Delegation Accuracy**: Verify correct agents are chosen
3. **Synthesis Quality**: Check how well responses are combined
4. **Learning Effectiveness**: Test if system adapts over time
5. **Emotional Appropriateness**: Verify emotional context integration

## üé≠ Sub-Agent Identity Testing

Each sub-agent has a unique identity. Test their specializations:

### COGITATOR (Thinker)
**Test:** `process through brain Analyze the philosophical implications of AI consciousness`
**Expected:** Deep analytical response with logical reasoning

### PERSONA (Identity Manager)
**Test:** `process through brain Evolve my personality to be more confident and assertive`
**Expected:** Identity evolution with trait modifications

### EMPATHIA (Emotion Processor)
**Test:** `process through brain I'm excited about my new project but also nervous`
**Expected:** Emotionally intelligent response addressing both emotions

### ELOQUENS (Responder)
**Test:** `process through brain Explain quantum computing to a 10-year-old`
**Expected:** Clear, age-appropriate communication

### JUDEX (Decision Maker)
**Test:** `process through brain Should I prioritize speed or accuracy in my responses?`
**Expected:** Strategic decision-making with trade-off analysis

### SCHOLAR (Learner)
**Test:** `process through brain What have you learned from our interactions today?`
**Expected:** Learning insights and behavioral adaptations

### VIGIL (Monitor)
**Test:** `process through brain Check system health and performance metrics`
**Expected:** System monitoring report with optimization suggestions

## üîÑ Integration Testing

1. **Emotion Engine Integration**: Verify emotional states affect decisions
2. **State Manager Integration**: Check state tracking and updates
3. **Response Cache Integration**: Test caching optimization
4. **Multi-Agent Manager Integration**: Verify workflow orchestration
5. **Help System Integration**: Test intelligent assistance

### Test Workflows

- **Response Quality**: Measured by user satisfaction
- **Processing Speed**: Time from input to response
- **Learning Integration**: Adaptation over time

### Qualitative Measures
- **Response Coherence**: Logical flow and consistency
- **Emotional Appropriateness**: Contextual emotional intelligence
- **Specialist Accuracy**: Correct agent selection for tasks
- **Identity Consistency**: Maintenance of agent personalities
- **User Satisfaction**: Overall user experience quality

## üéâ Expected Outcomes

When working properly, CEREBRUM should:
- ‚úÖ Act as the central decision-maker for all processing
- ‚úÖ Intelligently delegate to appropriate specialists
- ‚úÖ Synthesize multiple agent responses coherently
- ‚úÖ Adapt behavior based on emotional context
- ‚úÖ Learn from interactions and improve over time
- ‚úÖ Create new agents when specialized needs arise
- ‚úÖ Maintain consistent specialist identities
- ‚úÖ Integrate all system features seamlessly

## üö® Emergency Procedures

If CEREBRUM malfunctions:
1. **Emotional Reset**: `centralBrain.emergencyOverride('emotional_reset')`
2. **Cache Clear**: `centralBrain.emergencyOverride('cache_clear')`
3. **Identity Reset**: `centralBrain.emergencyOverride('identity_reset')`
4. **Restart System**: Stop and restart the agent
