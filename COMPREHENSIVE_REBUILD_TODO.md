## PHASE 7: PLUGIN SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION

### 7.1 Core Plugin Types (Self-Awareness as Plugins)
**ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLE**: All self-awareness features MUST be implemented as independent plugins to ensure modularity, prevent cross-dependencies, and enable granular control.

**PLUGIN BUNDLING SYSTEM**: Some plugins require others to function properly and will be organized into "Plugin Bundles" - collections of related plugins that install, enable, and disable together as a cohesive unit while maintaining individual plugin architecture for flexibility and troubleshooting.

**BUNDLE TYPES**:
- **Individual Plugins**: Standalone plugins that work independently (e.g., Name Recognition Plugin)
- **Bundled Plugins**: Related plugins that are packaged together but remain separate entities (e.g., Emotion Core Bundle: Emotion Core + Emotion Memory + Emotion Intensity)
- **Dependency Plugins**: Plugins that require other specific plugins to function (clearly documented dependencies)
- **Optional Enhancement Plugins**: Plugins that enhance bundle functionality but aren't required for basic operation

**BUNDLE INSTALLATION BEHAVIOR**:
- Installing a bundle installs ALL contained plugins simultaneously
- Disabling a bundle disables ALL plugins in the bundle
- Individual plugins within a bundle can be temporarily disabled for troubleshooting
- Bundle dependencies are automatically resolved during installation
- Clear bundle vs individual plugin distinction in UI and documentation
