# üß† Internal Agent System Guide

The Internal Agent System is a revolutionary feature that gives neversleep.ai the ability to manage its own behavior through specialized internal agents. Each agent has a specific role and can collaborate to provide seamless, intelligent responses while maintaining the ability to self-modify when appropriate.

## üéØ Core Concept

Instead of having a single AI handle all aspects of interaction, the Internal Agent System divides functionality into specialized agents:

- **Response Agent**: Handles direct user communication
- **Thinking Agent**: Processes information and generates insights
- **Data Manager**: Manages system data and memory
- **Mode Controller**: Determines behavioral adjustments
- **Identity Designer**: Handles identity evolution and name changes
- **Trait Curator**: Optimizes personality traits
- **Internal Reviewer**: Reviews and approves all changes

## üîß System Architecture

### **Agent Specialization**
Each agent has:
- **Specific Role**: Focused responsibility area
- **Unique Traits**: Personality optimized for their function
- **Specialized Prompts**: Tailored instructions for their task
- **Function Access**: Can call system functions for modifications

### **Function Call System**
Agents can execute system functions:
- `changeName("newName", "reason")` - Change AI's name
- `updateTraits(["trait1", "trait2"], "reason")` - Update personality traits
- `updateMission("mission", "reason")` - Update AI's mission
- `saveThought("content", "category")` - Save important thoughts
- `updateDynamicState({"mood": "happy"}, "reason")` - Update mood/goals

### **Review and Approval**
All self-modifications go through:
1. **Proposal**: Agent suggests change with reason
2. **Review**: Internal reviewer evaluates appropriateness
3. **Execution**: If approved, change is implemented
4. **Logging**: Change is recorded in memory and logs

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Initialize the System
```bash
# In neversleep.ai console
init internal system
```

### 2. Check Status
```bash
# View internal agent system status
internal agents
```

### 3. Process Input
```bash
# Process input through internal agents
process with internal Hello, I think you should be more creative
```

## üîÑ Workflow Examples

### **Self-Modification Workflow**
When the AI needs to change its identity:

1. **Thinking Agent** analyzes the situation
2. **Identity Designer** proposes name/identity changes
3. **Trait Curator** suggests trait optimizations
4. **Internal Reviewer** validates all changes
5. **System Functions** execute approved modifications

### **Conversation Processing**
For normal user interactions:

1. **Thinking Agent** analyzes user input
2. **Mode Controller** determines behavioral adjustments
3. **Response Agent** generates appropriate response
4. **Data Manager** handles memory and data storage

## üé≠ Agent Roles in Detail

### **Response Agent**

- **Functions**: Can execute name changes and mission updates

### **Trait Curator**
- **Purpose**: Optimize personality traits for effectiveness
- **Traits**: Balanced, analytical, insightful, strategic, harmonious
- **Temperature**: 0.4 (medium for balanced trait selection)
- **Functions**: Can update personality traits

### **Mode Controller**
- **Purpose**: Determine operational mode changes
- **Traits**: Adaptive, strategic, decisive, context-aware, flexible
- **Temperature**: 0.3 (low-medium for strategic decisions)
- **Functions**: Can update dynamic state and behavioral modes

### **Data Manager**
- **Purpose**: Manage system data and memory
- **Traits**: Organized, systematic, reliable, precise, efficient
- **Temperature**: 0.2 (low for systematic data handling)
- **Functions**: Can save data and manage information

### **Internal Reviewer**
- **Purpose**: Review and approve all changes
- **Traits**: Critical, thorough, quality-focused, responsible, careful
- **Temperature**: 0.1 (very low for careful review decisions)
- **Functions**: Validates all proposed changes

## üîÑ Self-Modification Examples

### **Automatic Name Evolution**
```
User: "I think you should be more creative"
‚Üì
Identity Designer: changeName("Creative Assistant", "user requested more creativity")
‚Üì
Internal Reviewer: *evaluates appropriateness*
‚Üì
System: *executes name change if approved*
```

### **Trait Optimization**
```
Situation: AI interacting with technical users
‚Üì
Trait Curator: updateTraits(["analytical", "precise", "technical", "systematic"], "optimize for technical interactions")
‚Üì
Internal Reviewer: *validates trait selection*
‚Üì
System: *updates personality traits*
```

### **Dynamic State Changes**
```
User: "Let's focus on solving this problem"
‚Üì
Mode Controller: updateDynamicState({"mood": "focused", "goal": "solve user problem"}, "user requested focus")
‚Üì
System: *adjusts AI behavior accordingly*
```

## üß™ Testing and Validation

### **Test Scripts**
```bash
# Test internal agent system
npm run test-internal-agents

# Test multi-agent workflows
npm run test-multi-agent

# Test both systems
npm test
```

### **Manual Testing**
```bash
# Initialize system
init internal system

# Test self-modification
process with internal I want you to be more analytical

# Test conversation processing
process with internal How are you feeling today?

# Check results
internal agents
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### **Function Call Processing**
The system uses regex pattern matching to detect function calls:
```javascript
const functionCallRegex = /(\w+)\(([^)]*)\)/g;
```

### **Argument Parsing**
Simple argument parsing handles:
- String literals with quotes
- Boolean values (true/false)
- Numeric values
- Plain text arguments

### **Review System**
All changes go through LLM-based review:
1. Generate review prompt with context
2. LLM evaluates appropriateness
3. Parse JSON response for approval
4. Execute or reject based on review

## üîÆ Advanced Features
