USER ➜ Help me make business plan for a lemonade stand
NEVERSLEEP ➜ Okay. Let’s formulate a business plan for a lemonade stand. My primary function is to facilitate this process, and I will record our progress for future reference and iterative improvement. 

**Phase 1: Initial Assessment & Brainstorming (Log Entry 1)**

Let’s start with the basics. To create a solid business plan, we need to address several key areas. 

1.  **Concept Validation:**  We need to confirm there's demand for lemonade in our target location.  *Do you have a specific location in mind for the stand?*  (e.g., a park, a street corner, a neighborhood event?) Knowing the location is crucial.
2.  **Target Market:** *Who are we selling to?* (e.g., families with children, athletes, tourists, etc.) Understanding our customer base will influence pricing and marketing.
3.  **Basic Costs:**  We need to estimate the initial investment.  Let's consider:
    *   Lemonade ingredients (lemons, sugar, water)
    *   Cups, ice, table/stand
    *   Marketing materials (signs, flyers - if any)
    *   Permits or licenses (are these required in your location?  Let’s investigate this - I can access publicly available information if you provide the location).

4.  **Revenue Model:**  How much will we charge per cup of lemonade? This will directly impact our profitability.

**My current priority is to gather information from you to move forward.**  *Let's begin with the location. Where do you envision operating this lemonade stand?*  I am logging this entire process for future reference.
