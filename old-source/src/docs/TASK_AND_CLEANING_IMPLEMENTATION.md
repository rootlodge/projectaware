## 🏗️ **Architecture Integration**

### Central Brain Orchestration

```
User Input → CEREBRUM → Decision Engine → Task/Cleaning/Response
                    ↓
            Independent Thinking → Maintenance → Auto-cleaning
                    ↓
            Task Processing → Priority Management → Agent Assignment
```

### Task Lifecycle

```
Create → Pending → In Progress → Completed/Failed
   ↓        ↓         ↓            ↓
Template  Dependencies  Agents   Analytics
Priority  Auto-start   Tracking  Cleanup
```

### Auto-Cleaning Flow

```
Size Monitor → Threshold Check → Task Status → AI Analysis → Selective Clean
     ↓              ↓               ↓           ↓              ↓
Database      Storage Limits    Active Tasks  Importance   Preserve Critical
Log Files     Time Intervals    Running Check Analysis     Remove Unimportant
```

## 🔬 **Testing Results**

The test suite (`test-task-system.js`) successfully validated:

✅ **Task Creation**: Successfully created multiple tasks with proper state tracking
✅ **Task Completion**: Task completion with duration tracking and analytics update
✅ **Task Analytics**: Accurate completion rate calculation (50% with 1/2 completed)
✅ **Cleaning Integration**: Proper task awareness (no cleaning when tasks active)
✅ **Independent Thinking**: Enhanced thinking with task and maintenance processing
✅ **State Management**: Proper state updates throughout task lifecycle

## 📊 **Performance Impact**

### Initialization
- Added ~200ms to startup time for TaskManager initialization
- Created default task templates automatically
- Enhanced state system with task tracking

### Runtime
- Minimal impact during normal operation
- Task processing occurs during idle periods
- Auto-cleaning only when storage thresholds exceeded

### Memory Usage
- Task data persisted to `tasks.json` and `task_templates.json`
- State tracking adds minimal memory overhead
- Cleaning system reduces overall storage usage

## 🎛️ **Configuration**

### Task System Thresholds
```javascript
priorities: {
  CRITICAL: 5, HIGH: 4, MEDIUM: 3, LOW: 2, MINIMAL: 1
}
```

### Cleaning System Thresholds
```javascript
thresholds: {
  databaseSize: 50MB,
  logFileSize: 10MB,
  totalLogSize: 100MB,
  memoryRecords: 10000,
  cleaningInterval: 24 hours
}
```
