This is a Next.js + Tailwind CSS project for the neversleep.ai agent UI. The UI should support:
- Voice-to-text input using the browser's built-in SpeechRecognition API (no AI required)
- A chat interface for interacting with the agent backend
- A modern dashboard look inspired by Metronic
- Future extensibility for agent state, logs, and controls
